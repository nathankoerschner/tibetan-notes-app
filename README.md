# མིང་ཚིག་བཟོ་སྒྲིག་གཉེན་ཆས། (lit: Dictionary App)

A mobile app built with React-Native for the collection of Tibetan terms. Uses [tibetan-sort-js](https://github.com/buda-base/tibetan-sort-js) from [BDRC](https://www.bdrc.io/) to solve the problem of Tibetan alphabetical sort, which is not correctly implemented in most operating systems. Built at the request of His Holiness the Drikung Kyabgön with collaborators for design and Tibetan translation.
